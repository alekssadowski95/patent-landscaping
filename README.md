# Patent Landscaping for Mechanical Engineering

The goal of this project is to automate the patent landscaping process in mechanical engineering, in order to quickly identify relevant patent documents and CPC categories from a patent database. We assume, that patent documents, which are cited often, are relevant.



This project includes 10K and 100K entries of patent documents.
